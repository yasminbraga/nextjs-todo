## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Sass with BEM - For styles
- Tests with jest and testing library
- @hello-pangea/dnd - Drag and drop library

### Continued development

This was my first project with unity tests. For improvement I think some test techniques are missing. Also some styles may be different, for example the add todo has a checkbox input and my project don't.

### Useful resources

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
